optimise for huge galeries -> paged/ondemand preview loading
show Exif info
when the overview is still loading, and an image is opened to fullsize, it cannot be closed by mouse until loading ended
when the previews are still loading, they block fullsize loading (set up priority queue?)
improve cross-browser compatibility (ie?)
NoScript version (via PHP)
add custom text feature for photos
sort by Exif date
stick footer to page bottom (even if the page is not filled)
PHP auto image preview generation
next and previous buttons: hide when at first or last photo
further localisation (es, fr, ru, ...)
add language selection menu
optimise for printing
download all function
optional captcha protection (?)
maybe try a prototypal implementation of Photo
